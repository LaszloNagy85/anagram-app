##Credit

The words list used as the basis for the dictionary was source from [this repo](https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english). It in turn is adapted from [Peter Norvig's](http://norvig.com/ngrams/) list of the [1/3 million most frequent English words](http://norvig.com/ngrams/count_1w.txt). I took the list of 10,000 words and removed anything over 8 characters.
